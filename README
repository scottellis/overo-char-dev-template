A starting point for a char-dev based driver, boiler-plate stuff. 

Do a global search and replace of 'template' with your driver
name in template.c and Makefile.

Rename template.c with <your-driver-name>.c

Source the source-me.txt file. You might have to change the KERNELDIR
variable to whatever kernel you are running.

The assumption is you are working on Gumstix overo's using the OE 
cross-build environment. But with small tweaks works for any Linux
system.
